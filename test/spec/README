This batch of test makes a connectivity test of the SPEC's components.

	- test00: checks voltage of the power pins in FMC connector.
	- test01: checks the low speed pins of FMC connector (low count connector).
	- test02: checks the EEPROM of the GENNUM chip. 
	- test03: loads a firmware file to Flash memory and boots from it. The FW just blink the leds.
	- test04: not present now. It should be SFP connectivity test.
	- test05: check SATA ports and high speed pins on FMC connector (low count connector).
	- test06: check Silabs SI570 oscillator.
	- test07: check data and address lines of DDR memory.
	- test08: check PLL and rest of oscillators on SPEC board.

This tests are made to work stand-alone too. So, it is possible to call each one using 'python test0x.py'

These tests are designed to use Python 2.7 or higher.
